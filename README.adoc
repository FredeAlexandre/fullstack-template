= SaaS Template

== Overview

The **SaaS Template** is a production-ready, highly scalable monorepo template designed for building Software as a Service (SaaS) applications with full-stack type safety, optimized developer experience, and modern best practices.

This repository provides a strong foundation for SaaS development, reducing boilerplate setup time while enforcing architectural best practices. It includes a modern tech stack with type safety, optimized database interactions, authentication, email handling, and an admin dashboard.

== Features

- **Monorepo Architecture**: Managed with `pnpm` and `sheriff` for efficient workspace handling.
- **Full-stack Type Safety**: Uses `Zod` and `TanStack Query` for API validation.
- **Database Management**: `Drizzle ORM` with PostgreSQL (production) and PGLite (development mode).
- **Authentication**: Pre-configured authentication with `Better-Auth`.
- **Email Handling**: Server-side rendering emails with `React-Email` and `Resend API`.
- **Admin Dashboard**: User management and role-based access control.
- **Example SaaS App**: Showcases authentication, database interactions, and email validation.
